# Introduction to Hyperdimensional Cognitive Models

Welcome to *Introduction to Hyperdimensional Cognitive Models*! This is a 
collection of tutorials for getting used to using
[Vector Symbolic Architectures](https://www.hd-computing.com/) (VSAs)
which is a mathematical formalism that we use in our lab to model cognition.

## Note:

This project is under active development.
