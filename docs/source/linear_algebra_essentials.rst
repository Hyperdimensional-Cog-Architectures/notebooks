Linear Algebra, the Essentials
==============================

In this workbook we will introduce just enough of the basics of linear 
algebra. This is because Vector-Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) are really just
fancy first-year linear algebra and matrix manipulation. 

Aside from the primer here, we recommend checking out::
