    "## What is Linear Algebra?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Linear algebra* is a generalization of the the simple operations over \n",
    "matrices and vectors that you may have learned about in your mathematics courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three fundamental objects that are used in the study of vector-symbolic\n",
    "architectures are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Scalars*, which are the regular numbers you know and love: e.g., $1$, \n",
    "$2$, $3$, and so on. These have the standard operations that you know and love\n",
    "too: we can add them like $1 + 2$, multiply them by $3(4)$, and so on, and so\n",
    "forth. In order to keep it clear when we're talking about scalars, the \n",
    "standard convention is to talk about scalars using Greek letters,\n",
    "$\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\dots, \\omega$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Vectors* can be thought of as *lists* of *scalars*. Each individual\n",
    "element of a vector is known as an *element*, *component*, or *coordinate*. We\n",
    "denote vectors by lower case Latin letters, and write them \n",
    "putting square brackets around the a comma-separated list\n",
    "of the elements:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\n",
    "$$\n",
    "We say that a vector with $n$ elements inside is $n$*-dimensional*. So, the\n",
    "above vector $[1,2,3,4,5]$ is a $5$-dimensional vector. In order to talk\n",
    "about elements inside of the vector, we need to use an *index*. \n",
    "So $v_1 = 1$, $v_2 = 2$, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Matrices* are vectors which have other vectors are their entries. Matrices\n",
    "are denoted with upper-case letters $A, B, \\dots, Z$. For a matrix $A$ with\n",
    "$n$-rows and $d$-columns, we say that $A$ is an $n \\times d$-dimensional\n",
    "matrix, or just an $n \\times d$ matrix for short. To write out a matrix,\n",
    "we extend the previous vector notation to include both rows and columns:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n",
    "4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n",
    "7 & 8 & 9\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "To talk about elements inside of the matrix, we need to know both the row\n",
    "and the column of the item. So, we need two numbers. For the $3 \\times 3$\n",
    "matrix $A$ above, the item at the $(1, 1)$ index, or $A_{11} = 1$, $A_{12} = 2$,\n",
    "$A_{13}=3$. The fist index denotes *which row to look at*, and the second \n",
    "index picks out *which column to look at*."
