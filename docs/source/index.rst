VSAs and Cognition
=================================================

Welcome to *VSAs and Cognition*! This is a 
collection of tutorials for getting used to using
`Vector Symbolic Architectures <https://www.hd-computing.com/>`_ (VSAs)
which is a mathematical formalism that we use in our lab to model cognition.

We will include a list of exercises to familiarize yourself with VSAs, as well
as their applications to cognitive modeling.

Note:
-----

This project is under active development.
