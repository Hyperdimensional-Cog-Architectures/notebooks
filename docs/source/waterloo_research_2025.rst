The ANIMUS lab and University of Waterloo collaborators are proud to announce the first Summit on Neurosymbolic Adaptive Programming (SNAP), to be held **August 11th-15th, 2025**, at the University of Waterloo. The week-long intensive research collaboration will focus on *vector-symbolic programming* and *neural adaptive control programs*. Vector-symbolic programming is a novel approach to neural networks where the latent states of the network can be treated as arbitrary programs and executed. Vector-symbolic changes the focus of neural computation from data points to sets and functions, expanding what neural networks can learn and do. The SNAP collaborators aim to explore a new frontier in neuro-symbolic computing and low-power robotics.
